Tomographic reconstruction creates three-dimensional views of an 
object by combining two-dimensional images taken from multiple 
directions, for example in how a CAT (computer-aided tomography) 
scanner allows 3D views of the heart or brain. Data collection 
can be rapid, but the required computations are massive. Further, 
many common experimental perturbations can degrade the quality of 
tomographs, unless corrections are applied. Unless automated tools 
make these corrections, beamline staff can be overwhelmed by data that 
can be collected far faster than corrections and reconstruction 
can be performed. 

To address the needs for image correction and tomographic reconstruction 
in an instrument independent manner, the TomoPy code was developed, which 
is a parallelizable high performance reconstruction code. The code is 
in use or planned to be so at most U.S. synchrotron facilities.
