Vector Reconstruction
---------------------

Here is an example on how to use the vector reconstruction algorithm :cite:`Phatak:15` (and ...)
with `TomoPy <http://tomopy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__:cite:`Gursoy:14a`.  

Two jupyter notebooks with two examples as well as with some mathematical concepts related to the vector reconstruction,
can be found in the tomopy/doc/demo folder.

The Vector Reconstruction examples html slides can be build by applying (from the doc/demo folder) the following commands:

``jupyter-nbconvert --to slides --post serve vectorrec_1.ipynb``

and

``jupyter-nbconvert --to slides --post serve vectorrec_disk.ipynb``
