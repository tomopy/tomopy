Loading tomographic data
============================

For reading tomography files formatted in different ways, please see the
`DXchange <http://dxchange.readthedocs.io>`_ package where there are various
examples and demonstration scripts about how to use the package for loading your
datasets.

The package can be installed alongside TomoPy with Conda by simply running the
following in a terminal::

    conda install -c conda-forge dxchange


For a repository of experimental and simulated data sets please check
`TomoBank <http://tomobank.readthedocs.io/>`_ :cite:`DeCarlo:17`.
