How to read tomographic data
============================

For reading tomography files formatted in different ways, please 
go check the `DXchange <http://dxchange.readthedocs.io>`_ package. There
are various examples and demonstration scripts about how to use the
package for loading your datasets. 

The package can be installed by simply running the following 
in a terminal::

    conda install -c conda-forge dxchange


For a repository of experimental and simulated data sets please check 
`TomoBank <http://tomobank.readthedocs.io/>`_ :cite:`DeCarlo:17`.
