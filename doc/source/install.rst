==================
Install directions
==================

This section covers the basics of how to download and install TomoPy.


Supported Environments
----------------------
TomoPy is tested, built, and distributed for python 2.7 3.6 3.7 on Linux/macOS
and python 3.6 3.7 on Windows 10.


OPTION 1: Installing from Conda (Recommended)
---------------------------------------------

If you only want to run TomoPy, not develop it, then you should install through
a package manager. Conda, our supported package manager, can install TomoPy and
its dependencies for you.

First, you must have `Conda <http://continuum.io/downloads>`_ installed,
then open a terminal or a command prompt window and run::

    $ conda install -c conda-forge tomopy

This will install TomoPy and all the dependencies from the conda-forge channel.

Updating the installation
=========================

TomoPy is an active project, so we suggest you update your installation
frequently. To update the installation run::

    $ conda update -c conda-forge tomopy

For some more information about using Conda, please refer to the
`docs <http://conda.pydata.org/docs>`__.


OPTION 2: Installing from source
-------------------------------------------

Please read the devguide for instructions on how to install TomoPy from source code.
