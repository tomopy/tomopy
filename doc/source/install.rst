Installing from source via command line
======================================
  
If you want to contribute to the development of TomoPy, you will 
need a local copy of the source code.  Clone from the 
`TomoPy repository <https://github.com/tomopy/tomopy>`_ on GitHub_::

    git clone https://github.com/tomopy/tomopy.git

then, inside your new cloned repo, run::

    sudo python setup.py develop
    
This puts a symlink to your development code in your python install directory, 
so that the tests will always run against your development code.

It is recommended that you use git to update your local code with changes from 
the upstream branch frequently.

Installing from Conda
=====================

If you only want to run TomoPy, not develop it, then 
you should install through a package manager.

First you must have `Conda <http://continuum.io/downloads>`_ installed, 
then open a terminal or a command prompt window and run::

    conda install -c dgursoy tomopy


Updating the installation
=========================

TomoPy is an active project, so we suggest you update your installation 
frequently. To update the installation run::

    conda update -c dgursoy tomopy

For some more information about using Conda, please refer to the 
`docs <http://conda.pydata.org/docs>`__.

Importing TomoPy
================

When importing, it is best to import TomoPy before importing numpy.  
See `this thread <https://github.com/tomopy/tomopy/issues/178>`_ for details.
