This section contains examples for using various TomoPy functions and plugins
from other packages.

The examples that do not require a GPU can be run in your browser using the
Binder link at the top of the page. Otherwise, you may run these
`Jupyter notebook <https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_
examples on your local machine or run the equivalent Python
scripts from `here <https://github.com/tomopy/tomopy/tree/master/doc/demo>`_.
