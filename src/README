To build and install the libtomopy share library, use

    python build_libtomopy.py

This will compile a shared library:
  libtomopy.so, libtomopy.dylib, or libtomopy.dll (Linux, MacOS, Windows)

and install it to ../tomopy/sharedlibs


For Windows, both MinGW-64 and make need to be installed and placed in the PATH,
so that the appropriate 'gcc.exe' (that is, one that supports C99) and
'make.exe' can be found.  For Anaconda Python on Windows, adding the conda
packages MinGW and make.
