To build and install a precompiled libtomopy, use

    python configure.py
    make -j4 install

This will compile and install a shared library 
  libtomopy.so, libtomopy.dylib, or libtomopy.dll (Linux, MacOS, Windows)
to ../tomopy/sharedlibs


This pre-compiled shared library will be used if no extension is built
at setup time, say by running 

    python setup_nocompile.py install

in the top-level directory. 


For Windows, MinGW-64 6.3 or higher should be installed and placed in
the PATH, so that the appropriate 'gcc.exe' (that is, that supports
C99) can be found.
