For Windows, both MinGW-64 and `make` need to be installed and placed in the
PATH, so that the appropriate 'gcc.exe' (that is, one that supports C99) and
'make.exe' can be found. For Anaconda Python on Windows, adding the conda
packages MinGW and make provides these resources.

Then use

    pip install .
